Real-Time Chat Application


This is a full-stack real-time chat application built using React (with MUI) for the frontend and Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.IO for the backend. It supports secure user authentication, one-to-one and group chats, real-time messaging with WebSockets, and user-friendly UI interactions. Users can register, log in, create groups, send messages, and receive instant updates. The backend handles data storage and socket communication efficiently, while the frontend ensures a responsive and intuitive user experience. This app also includes features like file uploads, user avatars, and notification handling, making it a robust solution for real-time communication.
